Statement:

"The Entropic Archive" is an interactive web experience that visualises the black hole information paradox through user participation and input. Users can submit texts- thoughts, poetry, or theories- which are gradually consumed by the simulated black hole, which undergoes entropy-driven corruption  distortion. As the time passes, the distortion increases, leading to glitches, cosmic noises explaining the theories of quantum preservation and realistic destruction. 
This project lets users experience various black hole theories/concepts such as Event Horizon, Hawking's Radiation, and Spaghettification.

(Technical Context: Built with Three.js, the project combines generative text decay, particle physics, and entropy escalation to create an image about cosmic uncertainty.)
